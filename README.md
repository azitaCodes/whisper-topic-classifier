# ðŸŽ§ Whisper Voice Topic Classifier

This project takes an English voice audio file and:

1. Converts the audio to text using OpenAI's Whisper
2. Predicts the topic (like cooking, health, education, or tech) using machine learning

---

## âœ… How It Works

- MP3 audio is converted to clean `.wav` format
- Whisper transcribes the audio to text
- A Naive Bayes classifier guesses what topic the text is about

---

## ðŸ§ª Sample Topics

- Cooking
- Health
- Education
- Tech
